This was a project I worked on for my operating Systems class at Kennesaw State University.

The purpose was to create an operating systems simulator that was able to pull in an instruction set in hexadecimal,
sort it based on its priority, run the instructions, record how long each instruction took, and return the results.

Unfortunately it was never completed due to the fact that my group partners had never worked with C++ before, and my
knowledge was very limited as well. This is the result. I specifically worked on the Loader and OS_Driver, and was the
only one to work on those files, however I did help with the other files when I was needed. 

My plan is to one day come back to this project and see if I can get it into a working state as per the instructions
given to us by the professor. In the meantime it will go untocuehd and serve as a memory to myself of why I should
always make sure I have partners who will actually attempt to contribute to the project instead of leaving me with
empty promises.
